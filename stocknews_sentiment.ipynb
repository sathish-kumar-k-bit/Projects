Last week, Airtel and Vodafone Idea had announced up to 25% hike in their prepaid plans tariffs to improve financials. \\n\\n\\tReliance Jio has raised prepaid smartphone tariffs by 20%. The hike has restored Jio\\'s tariff discount to Bharti. With most JioPhone tariffs unchanged, Jio\\'s subscriber traction should remain strong, believe analysts at Jefferies. Jio\\'s willingness to increase smartphone tariffs bodes well for its longer-term revenue/margin outlook, they added. \\n\\n\\t“Jio\\'s current move of increasing tariffs for smartphone users indicates that it wants to improve realizations while maintaining a 10-15% discount to Bharti in smartphone segment. This is positive for revenue and margin outlook for both Bharti and Jio,\" Jefferies\\' note stated. \\n\\n\\tBharti and VIL have consistently indicated that the tariff hikes have to continue periodically to ensure that the ARPUs reach a sustainable level of around  ₹300. RJio has not given any official word on it but the key to improvement in ROCE and sector valuation rerating will be to see continued improvement to achieve 30-40% higher ARPUs from the revised ARPU levels, said brokerage house Motilal Oswal.\\xa0 \\n\\n\\t\"RJio tariff hike is across all price plans including on Jiophone’s lowest 28 day plan.

The roughly 3% fall of RIL’s share price after the announcement of the deal being called off reflects this. However, investors have not stayed annoyed and this is reflected in the recent bounce back of the shares. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe prospects for the telecom business are upbeat. Reliance Jio announced tariff hikes on Sunday, following similar moves by competitors such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India Ltd earlier in the week. This improves the earnings outlook for the segment and RIL significantly. \\n \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t“Jio, the telecom vertical of Reliance Industries, is in a sweet spot as peers Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India Ltd have taken a 20% tariff hike,\" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL). They expect the hike to lead to a 22% and 7% upside on RJio and consolidated Ebitda. Improving traction in JioPhone Next should also help. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe telecom vertical had shown resilience in the September quarter. Average revenues per user (Arpu) during Q2 grew a healthy 3.7% on a sequential basis. The price hikes may further strengthen Arpu and margins.

The net profit surge that beat Street expectations was the best part of the results and prospects remain upbeat. No wonder, investors rewarded the company by driving up its shares more than 3% on Friday post earnings. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tAn increase in aluminium and alumina realizations on the back of a surge in base metal prices were behind the earnings beat for Hindalco. What’s more is that cost controls added to the company’s operating resilience. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tHindalco’s domestic revenues grew 83% year-on-year (y-o-y) and 30% sequentially. Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, accelerated 152% y-o-y and 38% sequentially to  ₹3,602 crore. This was significantly higher than analyst expectations. Since overall costs rose a mere 5% sequentially, the operating performance beat estimates. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tThe aluminium segment had everything working for it. Favourable macros, improved product mix and higher volumes all resulted in a decade-high Ebitda margin from the segment with Ebitda growing 173% y-o-y. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tOf course, a big contributing factor has been the surge in global metal prices. Analysts point out that average aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange (LME) during the quarter were up 58% y-o-y and 10% sequentially to $2,645/tonne. What helped Hindalco further is the 12% increase in aluminium metal sales. The share of value-added products (VAP) rose to 25% from 21% a year earlier, benefiting earnings. Aluminium VAP (excluding wire rods) sales volumes too were up 36% y-o-y, driven by a sharp recovery in the domestic market. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tTo be sure, Hindalco had to deal with rising input costs of coal and petroleum products, which put pressure',\n",

During the pandemic, to oil its wheels of growth, it has been pushing liquidity into the system. Now, it is ready to temper those flows. This is likely to impact liquidity levels, especially in emerging markets like India. As liquidity eases, investors will get more discerning. \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tOne measure of value is the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of a benchmark index like the 30-share BSE Sensex. This indicates the number of times the earnings of the 30 companies that make it are currently valued. A high PE ratio can either mean expectations of superior earnings growth, or overvaluation. At this point, India is one of the most richly-priced markets. And the PE ratio of the Sensex this year has touched its highest levels of the last two decades. \\nGreat Expectations \\n\\n\\t\\n\\tIn the past two decades, the PE',\n",
