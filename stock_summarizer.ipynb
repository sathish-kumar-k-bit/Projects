       " <p>Subject to pilot tests, initial studies predict that Medaro’s new lithium extraction process could deliver almost one-fifth of a tonne of Lithium Carbonate and one-quarter of a tonne of Lithium Hydroxide for every tonne of concentrated spodumene extracted from the rock.</p>,\n",

As the greater trend of decarbonization takes over, companies like FuelCell, and other alternative energy stocks, are likely to benefit in a big way.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Energy companies shouldn’t be ignored, either. As one the world’s leading renewables producers, <strong>NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE)</strong> is literally building the path towards sustainability. To make matters more exciting, the company was the number one capital investor in green energy infrastructure, and the fifth largest investor across all sectors.</p>,\n",
       " <p>NextEra Energy works with many different companies like Apple, Amazon, Nestle Waters North America among others to help them become more sustainable by investing in renewable energy sources as well as helping them reduce their carbon footprint through providing quality products and services that lower utility bills.</p>,\n",
       " <p>NextEra is the world’s leading producer of wind and solar energy, so it’s no surprise that it has received some love from the ‘millennial dollar.’ In fact, in 2018, the company was the number one capital investor in green energy infrastructure, and fifth largest capital investor across all sectors. No other company has been more active in reducing carbon emissions. And they’re just getting started. By 2025, the company aims to reduce their own emissions by 67 percent while doubling their electricity production from a 2005 benchmark. To put this into perspective, if all of America’s utilities were able to achieve NextEra Energy’s projected 2025 emissions rate, absolute CO2 emissions for the power sector would be approximately 75% lower than they were in 2005.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Even Big Oil is jumping on board, diversifying their portfolios and to hedge their bets in the rapidly changing new reality of energy. And no other oil major takes this more seriously than <strong>TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE).</strong> maintains a ‘big picture’ outlook across all of its endeavors. It is not only aware of the needs that are not being met by a significant portion of the world’s growing population, it is also hyper-aware of the looming climate crisis if changes are not made. In its push to create a better world for all, it has committed to contributing to each of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Total checks every box in the ESG checklist. It is promoting diversity and safety, making massive changes in its day to day operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound, and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner. It’s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward-thinking approach.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM)</strong> has seen its stock price nearly double from $30 in mid-February 2020 to $57 at close on February 16, 2021. Sociedad Química y Minera, for example, signed in December a long-term supply deal with LG Energy Solution, which in turn supplies batteries to carmakers such as Tesla and GM. Under the deal, SQM will supply battery-grade lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide to LG Energy Solution between 2021 and 2029.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The Chilean firm also announced a capital increase of up to US$1.1 billion, most of which will be used for lithium carbonate expansion in Chile, where SQM plans to more than double its production.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Sociedad Química y Minera sees the lithium industry growing at around 20 percent per year in the long term, supported by rising EV sales and emission reduction goals from China to the United States.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Charlotte, North Carolina-based <strong>Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB)</strong> has also seen its share price nearly double, from $139 to $271 over the past year.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Analysts are growing increasingly bullish on lithium producers’ stocks, mostly because of the upside potential in lithium prices in the medium term, thanks to the constantly growing demand for EV and storage batteries.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The two biggest lithium producers, Albemarle and SQM, have recently announced expansion projects and long-term supply deals as they believe the EV revolution and the energy transition are just beginning.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Albemarle is also raising money via a public offering of common stock, with proceeds expected at US$1.3 billion, which will be mostly invested in construction and expansion of lithium operations in Silver Peak, Nevada, as well as in Australia, Chile, and opportunities in China.</p>,\n",
       " <p>The biggest lithium producers are preparing for the growing EV demand, which is now coming not only from Tesla and Chinese start-ups, but also from established carmakers such as the highest-selling U.S. automaker GM and Jaguar.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Teck Resources (TSX:TECK)</strong> could be one of the best-diversified miners out there, with a broad portfolio of Copper, Zinc, Energy, Gold, Silver and Molybdenum assets. It’s even involved in the oil scene! With its free cash flow and a lower volatility outlook for base metals in combination with a growing push for copper and zinc to create batteries, Teck could emerge as one of the year’s most exciting miners.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Teck has had a great year, climbing from just $18 in January, to today’s price of $26.78. In addition to its positive trajectory, the company has seen a fair amount of insider buying, which tells shareholders that the management team is serious about continuing to add shareholder value. In addition to insider buying, Teck has been added to a number of hedge fund portfolios as well, suggesting that not only do insiders believe in the company, but also the smart money that’s really driving the markets.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Celestica (TSX:CLS)</strong> is a key company in the lithium boom due to is role as one of the top manufacturers of electronics in the Americas. Celestica’s wide range of products includes but is not limited to communications solutions, enterprise and cloud services, aerospace and defense products, renewable energy and enough health technology.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Thanks to its exposure to the renewable energy market, Celestica’s future is tied hand-in-hand with the green energy boom that’s sweeping the world at the moment. It helps build smart and efficient products that integrate the latest in power generation, conversion and management technology to deliver smarter, more efficient grid and off-grid applications for the world’s leading energy equipment manufacturers and developers.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Even old-school fossil fuel producers are getting in on this race. <strong>Suncor (TSX:SU) </strong>might be known mostly for its oil production. But it’s one of the few majors really pushing the boundaries. In fact, it has pioneered a number of high-tech solutions for finding, pumping, storing, and delivering its resources. When the rebound in crude prices finally materializes, giants like Suncor are sure to do well out of it. While many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production – those who focus on technological advancements in the area have a great long-term outlook. And that upside is further amplified by the fact that it is currently looking particularly under-valued compared to its peers.</p>,\n",
       " <p>But that’s just one part of its business, however. Suncor is also a world leader in renewable energy innovations. Recently, the company invested $300 million in a wind farm located in Alberta. Additionally, as Canada moves away from oil, Suncor is well positioned to take advantage of another one of the country’s resource reserves; Lithium. The best part? It doesn’t even have to move very far. In fact, Alberta’s oil sands are a major hotspot for lithium production.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX:LAC)</strong> is one of North America’s most important and successful pure-play lithium companies. With two world-class lithium projects in Argentina and Nevada, Lithium Americas is well-positioned to ride the wave of growing lithium demand in the years to come. It’s already raised nearly a billion dollars in equity and debt, showing that investors have a ton of interest in the company’s ambitious plans, and it will likely continue its promising growth and expansion for years to come.</p>,\n",
       " <p>It’s not ignoring the growing demand from investors for responsible and sustainable mining, either. In fact, one of its primary goals is to create a positive impact on society and the environment through its projects. This includes cleaner mining tech, strong workplace safety practices, a range of opportunities for employees, and strong relationships with local governments to ensure that not only are its employees being taken care of, but locals as well.</p>,\n",
       " <p>Lithium Americas’ efforts have paid off in the market, as well. While many companies across multiple industries struggled last year, Lithium Americas’ stock soared. In February last year, the company’s stock price was sitting at just $5.26, while today it is at $21.12, representing a 300% return for investors who bought in just a year ago.</p>,\n",
       " <p><strong>Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TSX:TRQ) </strong>is a key player in Canada’s resource and mineral industry. It is a major producer of coal and zinc, two resources with distinctly different futures. While headlines are already touting the end of coal, zinc is a mineral that will play a key role in the future of energy for years and years to come.</p>,\n",
       " <p>In addition to its zinc operations, Turquoise Hill is also a significant producer of Uranium. Uranium is a key material in the production of nuclear energy, which many analysts are suggesting could be a major component in the global transition to cleaner energy. While the mineral has not seen significant price action in recent years, there are a number of new projects set to come online across the globe in the medium term, which could be a boon to Turquoise Hill, especially as alternative energies gain traction in the marketplace.</p>,\n",

       "\" In Austin, Texas, Elon Musk is building his Tesla Cybertruck plant… And is developing a new technology to supply their huge lithium requirements. Even Samsung is moving production from overseas to Texas Why? American lithium is expected to be in high-demand for the next century… And early investors in the companies set to profit could receive significant returns on their investment in 2022. Few investors may know that the US has some of the world’s largest lithium reserves… And with supply-chain issues and China’s emergence as a lithium power-house… Lithium production is now flooding back to America. We think one little-known stock could benefit the most because it is the leader in what could become a unique, new lithium extraction technology… Details below… LITHIUM DEMAND ESTIMATED TO INCREASE 40X: 25,000 TONNE DEFICIT PER YEAR FORECASTED! Not only do supply chain issues have American companies scrambling to bring business back to America… But current levels and types of lithium extraction may not be able to keep up with demand... Lithium demand is estimated to increase by up to 40x over the next two decades, with automakers around the world committing to majority-EV production and renewable energy becoming the holy grail. The majority of the world’s lithium is currently mined in Chile and Australia. And the majority of what is mined is then processed in China. China is controlling supply, which is a national security issue for the United States. The situation has EV companies like Tesla scrambling to secure American lithium supply deals. On November 1st, Tesla finally reached a three-year lithium supply contract with the world’s largest producer, Ganfeng Lithium Co. But it’s still not enough to satiate Tesla’s needs, let alone everyone else’s. The bulk of the world’s lithium supplies are extracted from liquid brine reservoirs located beneath salt flats, and a deficit is already being felt. BMI's George Miller forecasts a lithium carbonate deficit of 25,000 tonnes this year. By next year, he expects that deficit to be much more serious. For the Biden Administration, securing domestics sources of lithium is a matter of national security. ELECTRIC VEHICLE PRODUCTION TO CREATE EPIC DEMAND BY ALL MAJOR CAR MANUFACTURERS Biden’s blueprint for domestic lithium production, refining and battery manufacturing is expected to drive a possible EV sales increase of up to 50% by 2030. For EV makers and battery manufacturers, like Tesla, it’s all about new technologies that\""

       "  'The frequent churn in the Sensex is as much a testament to the dynamic nature of the Indian economy as the decline of a once-dominant airline, Jet Airways, which suspended operations last week. \\n\\n\\tThe Indian equity market was in the midst of turmoil a hundred years ago, as the speculative boom after the end of World War 1 ended. The colonial government set up a committee in 1923 to take a closer look at the operations of the Native Share and Stock Brokers’ Association of Bombay, aka the Bombay Stock Exchange. The report of the committee has data on perhaps the first index of tradable securities — dominated by textile companies — with July 1914 prices as the base. “Considerable difficulty was experienced from the absence of daily official lists … It is desirable that the Bombay Stock Exchange should publish daily official lists on the lines of the London Stock Exchanges and similar exchanges. Where considerable fluctuations take place it is desirable that the opening, closing, highest and lowest prices should be known,\" the committee members complained in their report. \\n\\n\\tSuch a lack of basic price information is worth recalling at a time when a lot of attention has been focused in recent days on the fortieth anniversary of the benchmark BSE Sensitive Index (Sensex). As Narendra Nathan pointed out in the Economic Times, the Sensex was set up only in 1986, though its base is 1979. The Reserve Bank of India constructed an index of traded securities in 1949, but Indian investors had to wait till 1986 for a credible daily gauge of market movements. \\n\\n\\tThe list of 30 companies that make up the Sensex have changed since 1986. The changing composition of the benchmark index offers interesting clues about the changing nature of the Indian corporate sector. \\n\\n\\tThe first iteration of the Sensex was dominated by the Tata Group. There were as many as six Tata companies in the index — ACC, Tata Power, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, Voltas and Indian Hotels.

The colonial government set up a committee in 1923 to take a closer look at the operations of the Native Share and Stock Brokers’ Association of Bombay, aka the Bombay Stock Exchange. The report of the committee has data on perhaps the first index of tradable securities — dominated by textile companies — with July 1914 prices as the base. “Considerable difficulty was experienced from the absence of daily official lists … It is desirable that the Bombay Stock Exchange should publish daily official lists on the lines of the London Stock Exchanges and similar exchanges. Where considerable fluctuations take place it is desirable that the opening, closing, highest and lowest prices should be known,\" the committee members complained in their report. \\n\\n\\tSuch a lack of basic price information is worth recalling at a time when a lot of attention has been focused in recent days on the fortieth anniversary of the benchmark BSE Sensitive Index (Sensex). As Narendra Nathan pointed out in the Economic Times, the Sensex was set up only in 1986, though its base is 1979.

Tech stocks chiefly powered the markets along with energy, telecom, and capital goods, while auto and pharma showed weak gains Benchmark indices opened with gaps up but remained largely range-bound for most of the forenoon session. A rally began around noon with more results coming in and continued strongly into the green. The IPO of Latent View Analytics Ltd is closing today. It was subscribed 316.63 times as of 03:38 pm. Shares of Fino Payments Bank, which listed on the exchanges on Friday, closed at a discount of 5.50% on issue price. Nifty made a bullish bar today , it closed at 18,100 up by 225 points. However volumes on daily charts were lesser than its average. Aggressive traders can consider buy on dips with strict stop loss, while others should wait for a volume confirmation. Nifty has resistance in 18,150-18,200 range and support in 17,950-18,050 range. Nifty made a bullish bar today , it closed at 18,100 up by 225 points.

Next week would be crucial for the Nifty. If we can keep above 18150 for a couple of sessions, the markets can scale up higher to 18400 and then 18600. This will also take out the upper end of the current range which will add further momentum to the index. We respected the gap opening and the index moved up further to close above 18100.

This is the highest ever accumulation of investor wealth for the Indian markets in a financial year. \\n\\n\\tMeasured in terms of total market capitalization of all listed stocks on the BSE, overall investor wealth grew to  ₹203 trillion, up from  ₹113 trillion in the beginning of April 2020, BSE data showed. In FY20, investor wealth had depleted by 24.89% as the markets plunged because of a sharp sell-off in March 2020. In 2018-19, investors had gained  ₹8.84 trillion as the market capitalization of BSE-listed companies rose to  ₹151.08 trillion. \\n \\n\\n\\tIndia’s benchmark indices, the Sensex and Nifty, gained 69-71% in FY21, hitting record highs multiple times during the fiscal year. Smaller stocks gave strong returns to investors, with Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 rising 100.04% and 128.31%, respectively. \\n\\n\\tMarket growth was primarily driven by foreign investors. “India has outperformed emerging markets for over three months and is trading above its historical price to equity premium to emerging markets. Relative to bonds, equities are in the 75th percentile historical range. After months of buying, foreign institutional investor ownership has touched peak levels. Of the risks we would keep an eye on, commodity costs are right on top,\" noted analysts at UBS Securities in a client note on 17 March. \\n\\n\\tAmong conglomerates, market capitalization of the Adani group rose the most, multiplying more than four times from  ₹1.22 trillion at the start of the fiscal to  ₹5.44 trillion now. The market cap of Adani Green, which is not part of the benchmark Nifty, has risen close to seven times from a shade above  ₹24,000 crore at the beginning of the year to  ₹1.86 trillion. Adani Ports’ market cap gained a little less than three times from  ₹51,000 crore in April 2020 to  ₹1.39 trillion. \\n\\n\\tThe market capitalization of 28 listed firms of the Tata group was',\n",
